        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).</p>
        <h4>What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h4>
        <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is said to be a “developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life.</p>
        <h4>What are the symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h4>
        <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that involves persistent challenges in social interaction, speech and nonverbal communication, and restricted/repetitive behaviors. The effects of ASD and the severity of symptoms are different in each person.</p>
        <h4>What causes Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h4>
        <p>There is no known single cause for autism spectrum disorder, but it is generally accepted that it is caused by abnormalities in brain structure or function. Brain scans show differences in the shape and structure of the brain in children with autism compared to neurotypical children.</p>
        <h4>How is Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosed?</h4>
        <p>Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be difficult, since there is no medical test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorders. Doctors look at the child’s behavior and development to make a diagnosis.</p>
        <h4>What are the treatments for Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h4>
        <p>There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, but early intervention can make a big difference in the lives of many children. Early intervention services help children from birth to 3 years old (36 months) learn important skills. Services can include therapy to help the child talk, walk, and interact with others.</p>
        <h4>What is the difference between Autism and Asperger's Syndrome?</h4>
        <p>Asperger's Syndrome is a developmental disorder that is considered to be on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. People with Asperger's Syndrome may have difficulty with social interactions and exhibit a restricted range of interests and/or repetitive behaviors.</p>
        <h4>What is the difference between Autism Spectrum Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder?</h4>
        <p>Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) is a term used to describe a group of disorders characterized by delays in the development of socialization and communication skills. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior.</p>
        <h4>What is the difference between Autism Spectrum Disorder and Rett Syndrome?</h4>
        <p>Rett Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects brain development, resulting in severe mental and physical disability. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior.</p>
        <h4>What is the difference between Autism Spectrum Disorder and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder?</h4>
        <p>Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD) is a rare condition characterized by late onset of developmental delays or severe and sudden reversals in development. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior.</p>
